# The-Open-Source-Godot-Game
An attempt to make a game within Godot that is about coding Godot.  It should eventually help
them/me to code Godot!
First, super noobs are welcome to work on this project, putt around, eat some of our free cookies,
 talk about the horrors of modern politics in some hidden text file, etc.  Welcome all.  Also, i
  have never ran one of these things before!

This game has several goals, but first and for most is entertainment!  

Most games that have some useful goal go about it like a totalitarian or modern schools.  All
 silly work, silly tests, silly study.  PFFT!!!  We don't aim for work here, some grind, sure,
some gray area, maybe.  This is osmosis level learning, so long as things are enjoyed.  I,
 personally, can not learn efficiently if i feel like i am working or forcing myself or under
    compulsion.

Main thing:  This game will be all about skill levels, resources, and such.  Collecting those
 radiant godot gear faces!

Anyways, potential goals:

1:  Simulation of a players stats and skills.  Nice little help for noobies, probably, very round
 about, but it could be a fun little part of the game.  Example:  {"Beginner Level Programming
  Skills": {"Dictionaries": 1, "JSON": 0}}  #Estimated time to upgrade JSON from 0 - 1 is 5
   minutes (not real time (unless u wanna put that horrible option in :P)) JSON doesn't have too
    much complexity so it maxes at like 3 or something, till mastery/expert type skills.


2:  Gathering (or something) of code pieces, functions, classes, data sets, etc. though none
 actually running (that would be far to much work right?).  They'd have stats and such and would
  be parts of real functioning code.  Uhm, though it feels like this may encourage code
   "hoarding", slow coding.  If its a problem you keep your fork I'll keep mine.

3:  There were many other possible goals i forget them, but eventually the game must be permeable
 to mini game like add-ons.  Mini games that are (eventually) not just weak vestigial disconnected
  add-ons, but rather integrated into the game as seamlessly as those little shops in The Legend
   of Zelda N64.
